Setup notes for shadcn UI and framer-motion

- `shadcn` components initialized. Files are under `components/ui/`.
- `Button` and `Input` components were generated (`components/ui/button.tsx`, `components/ui/input.tsx`).
- `framer-motion` is installed; import with `import { motion } from 'framer-motion'`.

Quick usage examples:

- `import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"`
- `import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input"`

If you'd like, I can add more components (icons, dialog, navigation) or scaffold a sample mobile screen using these components.
